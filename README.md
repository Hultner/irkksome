##Introduction
IRC or Internet Relay Chat is a messaging protocol for communication
with groups or individuals over the internet. It was created in 1988
and has been used ever since. Therefore there are a plethora of clients
with 20th century thinking. The demand for a new, 21st century client,
for 21st century devices is obvious.
 
##Product vision
For IRC users who are using their Android phones to connect to IRC,
irkksome is the client that will revolutionize the way we
communicate on mobile devices. Drawing upon modern messaging platforms
and idioms, with our product, we show that an IRC-client can be more than a 
terminal or look like a hacker chat. The world of IRC clients for Android 
are in need for change - and weâ€™re determined to do that!

##irssi-proxy support
In irkksome, you can connect to an existing irssi session. There's no need to use Irssi ConnectBot anymore! Set up irssi proxy and hook up our magical irssi script, and you will have rich access to your irssi session from your phone or tablet.
